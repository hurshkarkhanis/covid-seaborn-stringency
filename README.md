Plotting COVID data with Seaborn
Using Jupyer Notebook and an extensive COVID dataset from ourworldindata.org, I manually 
manipulated the csv dataset to only include data from India and the United States, 
and only include one metric, stringency index.. I then plotted the data with Seaborn.

Stringency index is a way to measure how much a country is closing down. The the higher the number, 
the more resctrctions imposed. The most recent link has a great graph that allows users to track the 
stringency index of every country in the world over time.
